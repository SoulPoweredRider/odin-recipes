    <h1>Instructions</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine flour, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Toss beef in flour mixture. </li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a large Dutch oven or pot over medium-high heat. Shake off any excess flour from the beef and brown in small batches. Remove and set aside in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Add the onions to the pot, adding more oil as needed, and cook until they begin to soften, about 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add beef broth and red wine while scraping up any brown bits in the pan.</li>
        <li>Stir in browned beef, potatoes, carrots, celery, tomato paste, and rosemary. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer 1 hour or until beef is tender (up to 90 minutes).</li>
        <li>Mix equal parts cornstarch and water to create a slurry. Slowly add the slurry to the boiling stew to reach desired consistency (you may not need all of the slurry, if you'd like a thicker stew, you can add extra).  </li>
        <li>Stir in peas and simmer 5-10 minutes before serving . Season with salt & pepper to taste.</li>
    </ol>
